# Privacy Policy for WordPlayr

**Effective Date: November 12, 2025**

Phillip McElwee ("I," "me," or "Developer") operates the WordPlayr mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how I handle your information when you use the App. WordPlayr is a word-finding tool designed for puzzles and games, and it does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. If you have questions about this policy, contact me at [your-email@example.com] (replace with your actual email).

## Information I Collect
- **No Personal Information Collected**: The App does not require user accounts, logins, or any form of registration. I do not collect personal data such as your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other identifiers.
- **Device and Usage Data**: The App may automatically collect limited non-personal device information (e.g., device model, OS version, app version) solely for debugging and feedback purposes when you voluntarily submit a report via the in-app feedback form. This data is anonymized and not linked to you personally. No analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) or crash reporting services are used unless explicitly added in future updates.
- **In-App Purchases**: If you choose to upgrade to premium features (e.g., advanced filters and themes), purchases are processed through the Google Play Store. I do not handle or store your payment information—Google manages all billing details. For details on Google's data practices, refer to the [Google Play Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/index.html) and [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **No Third-Party Data Collection**: The App does not use third-party advertising, tracking pixels, or SDKs that collect data. No data is shared with advertisers or analytics providers.

## How I Use Information
Since no personal information is collected, there is no usage of such data. Any device info from feedback forms is used only to improve the App (e.g., fixing bugs) and is deleted after review.

## Sharing of Information
I do not share, sell, or disclose any information collected through the App with third parties, except as required by law (e.g., in response to a subpoena or court order).

## Data Security
Although minimal data is handled, I take reasonable measures to protect any information processed by the App from unauthorized access or loss. However, no system is completely secure, so use the App at your own risk.

## Children's Privacy
The App is not directed at children under 13 (or 16 in the EEA). I do not knowingly collect data from children. If I learn that a child has used the App, I will delete any related data.

## International Users
The App is hosted in the United States. If you access it from outside the US, your data (if any) may be transferred to and processed in the US, which may have different data protection laws.

## Changes to This Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with a revised effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Your Rights
Since no personal data is collected, there are no data access, deletion, or portability requests to process. For questions, contact me at phillip@wordplayr.app.

This policy complies with Google Play requirements and applies only to the App. Third-party services (e.g., Google Play) have their own policies.
